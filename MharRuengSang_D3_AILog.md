### What Was Accepted ✅

#### 1. Java Version Management
- ✅ **Version Detection** - Used `/usr/libexec/java_home` to identify installed JDKs
- ✅ **Environment Configuration** - Set `JAVA_HOME` explicitly to JDK 25
- ✅ **Standardized Launch** - All services now use consistent Java version
- ✅ **Command Template:**
  ```bash
  export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-25.jdk/Contents/Home && \
  cd [service-directory] && mvn spring-boot:run
  ```

#### 2. Port Conflict Resolution
- ✅ **Port Detection** - Used `lsof -i :PORT` to identify processes
- ✅ **Process Termination** - Implemented clean kill procedures
- ✅ **Verification** - Added checks to confirm ports are freed
- ✅ **Commands Used:**
  ```bash
  # Kill specific service
  pkill -f "api-gateway"
  pkill -f "restaurant-service"
  
  # Kill by port
  lsof -ti:8082 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
  
  # Verify cleanup
  lsof -i :8080 -i :8081 -i :8082 | grep LISTEN
  ```

#### 3. Database Management
- ✅ **Connection Termination** - Killed active PostgreSQL connections
- ✅ **Database Recreation** - Dropped and recreated locked databases
- ✅ **Permission Grants** - Ensured mhar_user has full privileges
- ✅ **Commands Used:**
  ```bash
  # Terminate connections and recreate database
  docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
    "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mhar_restaurants';"
  
  docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
    "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mhar_restaurants;"
  
  docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
    "CREATE DATABASE mhar_restaurants;"
  
  docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
    "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mhar_restaurants TO mhar_user;"
  ```

#### 4. Service Startup Procedures
- ✅ **Sequential Startup** - Proper order: Database → API Gateway → Services
- ✅ **Background Execution** - Services run in separate terminal sessions
- ✅ **Health Checks** - Verification of service availability
- ✅ **Startup Pattern:**
  ```bash
  # 1. Verify database is running
  docker ps | grep mhar-postgres
  
  # 2. Start API Gateway first (port 8080)
  cd api-gateway && mvn spring-boot:run
  
  # 3. Start microservices (ports 8081, 8082)
  cd order-service && mvn spring-boot:run
  cd restaurant-service && mvn spring-boot:run
  ```

#### 5. Error Handling and Diagnostics
- ✅ **Log Analysis** - Systematically reviewed error messages
- ✅ **Root Cause Identification** - Traced issues to Java version, ports, DB
- ✅ **Verification Steps** - Added health check queries after fixes
- ✅ **Commands Used:**
  ```bash
  # Check service health
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
  
  # Verify Java version
  which java && java -version
  
  # Check database connectivity
  docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d mhar_orders -c \
    "SELECT current_database();"
  ```

### What Was Rejected/Modified ❌

#### 1. Initial Quick Fixes ⚠️
- **Rejected Approach:** Simply restarting services without investigation
- **Issue:** Doesn't address root causes, leads to recurring failures
- **Modification:** Implemented systematic diagnostics before fixing

#### 2. Database Migration Strategy ⚠️
- **Initial Suggestion:** Manual SQL scripts for each fix
- **Enhancement:** Implemented repeatable database reset procedure
- **Rationale:** Need consistent way to reset environment during development

#### 3. Process Management ⚠️
- **Initial Approach:** Using Ctrl+C to stop services
- **Issue:** Left zombie processes and locked ports
- **Modification:** Added explicit pkill commands with verification
- **Implementation:**
  ```bash
  # Clean shutdown with verification
  pkill -f "restaurant-service" && sleep 2
  lsof -ti:8082 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
  sleep 2 && echo "Port cleaned"
  ```

# Verify ports released
lsof -i :8082
# Expected: Empty or showing new process only
```

**Results:** ✓ Clean process management, no zombie processes

### Issues Encountered and Solutions

#### Issue #1: Java Version Mismatch
**Problem:**
```
Error: A JNI error has occurred
UnsupportedClassVersionError: Compiled with version X but running on version Y
```

**Root Cause:** Services compiled with JDK 25 but running with different Java version

**Solution:**
```bash
# Detect available JDKs
/usr/libexec/java_home -V

# Set JAVA_HOME explicitly
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-25.jdk/Contents/Home

# Verify
java -version  # Should show version 25
```

**Verification:** ✓ All services now start without version errors

#### Issue #2: Port Already in Use
**Problem:**
```
Port 8082 was already in use
Failed to start RestaurantServiceApplication
```

**Root Cause:** Previous service instance not properly terminated

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find and kill process using port
lsof -ti:8082 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Verify port is free
lsof -i :8082
# Should return empty

# Wait before restarting
sleep 2
```

**Verification:** ✓ Services can now bind to ports successfully

#### Issue #3: Database Connection Refused
**Problem:**
```
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: database "mhar_restaurants" does not exist
Connection refused to database
```

**Root Cause:** Database not initialized or previous instance locked

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill all connections to database
docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
  "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mhar_restaurants';"

# Recreate database
docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
  "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mhar_restaurants;"

docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
  "CREATE DATABASE mhar_restaurants;"

# Grant permissions
docker exec -it mhar-postgres psql -U mhar_user -d postgres -c \
  "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mhar_restaurants TO mhar_user;"
```

**Verification:** ✓ Services can now connect to database successfully

#### Issue #4: Zombie Processes
**Problem:**
- Services appear stopped but ports still occupied
- New instances fail to start
- Multiple Java processes running

**Root Cause:** Services not properly killed, left in zombie state

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill by service name pattern
pkill -f "restaurant-service"
pkill -f "api-gateway"

# Force kill any remaining processes
lsof -ti:8080 -ti:8081 -ti:8082 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Wait for cleanup
sleep 3

# Verify all cleared
ps aux | grep -i spring-boot | grep -v grep
```

**Verification:** ✓ Clean process table, services can restart
